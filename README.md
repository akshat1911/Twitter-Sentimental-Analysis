# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets from Twitter. The goal is to analyze whether the sentiment of a tweet is positive, negative, or neutral based on its text content. We use various machine learning techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to achieve accurate sentiment classification.

## Features

- **Real-time Tweet Analysis**: Collect tweets using Twitter API.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Visualization**: Displays sentiment distribution using various charts.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes pretrained models for accurate sentiment prediction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Tweepy (for interacting with the Twitter API)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Numpy (for numerical operations)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
- TextBlob or VADER (for sentiment analysis)
